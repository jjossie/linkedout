# Professional Network

##### WDD 430

Throughout the semester, we will do several different projects in this repository. We will be building a professional social networking application, something like LinkedIn.

This project has two main parts:

- [The Frontend](frontend) which contains the browser application that will be written in React.
- [The Backend](backend) which contains the backend application that will be written with ExpressJS and Mongo.
- [Projects](projects) will contain all the markdown files for the different projects. These will be delivered throughout the semester in Canvas.
