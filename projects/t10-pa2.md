# Topic 9: Programming Assignment 2

In this assignment, you will create new API endpoints for suggested connections and build a component on your feed page to display them.

## Requirements

- Create a new endpoint with the following path: `GET /user/suggestedConnections`
  - For now, this endpoint should return _all_ users in the database, with the following exceptions:
    - The requesting user should not be included
    - Any current connections should not be included
    - Any _requested_ connections should not be included
    - And finally, anyone that has _sent the requesting user a connection request_ should also not be included
- Create a component on your frontend called `SuggestedConnections`
  - It should use a `useEffect` hook to load data from: `/user/suggestedConnections`
  - Each connection in the new component should have:
    - An avatar image. For now it will just display the initials of the user
    - The users full name
    - A button to "request" the user to connect with you
- Create a new endpoint with the following path: `POST /user/requestConnection`
  - The post body should look like this: `{ "userId": "63dbf680262b2df23bb945dd" }`
  - It should use the new connection model to create the connection request
- We will also spend some time in class this week synchronizing our data models so that we can all use a common database. The assignment in Canvas will have a zip file with the Models that you should use
- After you have updated your models, use this connection string from now on:
  - `mongodb+srv://students:RILnPuIPTo92RCu4@winter2023.inr9f0r.mongodb.net/class?retryWrites=true&w=majority`
  - Please don't run the seed script on the new database :D
