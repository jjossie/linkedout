# Topic 11: Programming Assignment 1

In this assignment, you will adapt the frontend `/connectionRequests` page to work with the new data model, as well as add buttons that will allow a user to accept or reject a connection request.

## Requirements

- You will first need to modify `GET /user/connectionRequests` because it doesn't contain all of the data that is needed for display
  - A `Connection` object does not contain any user information. You will need to come up with a data format that contains all of the information needed to display properly on the frontend
- Make sure that your `PUT /connection/:connectionId` endpoint works with the new data model
  - You will be able to accept a connection request with the following request body: `{ "accepted": true }`
- Make sure that your `DELETE /connection/:connectionId` endpoint works with the new data model
- You should have already created a route for `/connectionRequests` on your frontend. It will need the following modifications:
  - Modify the component to have buttons that will accept or reject the connection request
  - The button to accept the connection request should call `PUT /connection/:connectionId` when clicked
  - The button to reject the connection request should call `DELETE /connection/:connectionId` when clicked

## Cleanup

- There are a lot of API endpoints that we are not using on the frontend, mostly all of the CRUD endpoints we did at the beginning. Do an audit of all your endpoints and remove any that are not currently being used on the frontend.

## Additional Weekly Requirements

You should spend a couple of hours working on the styling of your Professional Network app. You can use any of the following for styling:

- https://styled-components.com/
- Global Stylesheets
- Style Sheet per component
- Inline CSS
- React Material UI Components
