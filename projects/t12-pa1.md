# Topic 12: Programming Assignment 1

After this assignment is completed, the logged in user will be able to create posts.

## Requirements

- First, you will need to create an endpoint that allows the user to make a post: `POST /user/post`
  - The request body should look like this: `{ "text": "luke, i am your father" }`
  - Your backend code will then insert a new document into the Posts collection, using the `userId` from the token
- You will then need to hook up your `PostPrompt` component to call the new endpoint
  - Please modify the `PostPrompt` to have just a text box and a button to submit the new post. You can remove the other buttons for now.

## Additional Weekly Requirements

You should spend a couple of hours working on the styling of your Professional Network app. You can use any of the following for styling:

- https://styled-components.com/
- Global Stylesheets
- Style Sheet per component
- Inline CSS
- React Material UI Components
